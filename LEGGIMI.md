Event-driven design is an architectural paradigm that focuses on the production, detection, consumption, and 
reaction to events in a system. In the context of Java and popular messaging systems like Kafka, RabbitMQ, and AWS SQS/SNS,
event-driven design is often implemented to build scalable, loosely coupled, and responsive systems.

Key Concepts:

    Events:
        Events represent meaningful occurrences in a system.
        Examples include user interactions, system state changes, or external notifications.

    Producers:
        Producers are components responsible for generating and publishing events.
        In Java, you can use Kafka producers, RabbitMQ publishers, or AWS SDK for SQS/SNS to send events.

    Brokers:
        Brokers act as intermediaries that facilitate the communication between producers and consumers.
        Examples include Kafka brokers, RabbitMQ brokers, and the SQS/SNS services in AWS.

    Consumers:
        Consumers are components that subscribe to events and perform actions in response.
        In Java, you can use Kafka consumers, RabbitMQ consumers, or AWS SDK for SQS/SNS subscribers.

Implementations:

    Kafka:
        Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that allows for the publishing and consumption of records, where each
        record represents an event.
        Producers publish events to Kafka topics, and consumers subscribe to these topics to receive events.
        Java applications can use the Kafka producer and consumer APIs to interact with Kafka.

        -- Example Kafka Producer (using Kafka Producer API):
        var properties = new Properties();
        properties.put("bootstrap.servers", "kafka-broker1:9092,kafka-broker2:9092");
        properties.put("key.serializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");
        properties.put("value.serializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");
        
        KafkaProducer<String, String> producer = new KafkaProducer<>(properties);
        ProducerRecord<String, String> record = new ProducerRecord<>("my_topic", "key", "value");
        
        producer.send(record);
        producer.close();

        -- Example Kafka Consumer (using Kafka Consumer API):
        Properties properties = new Properties();
        properties.put("bootstrap.servers", "kafka-broker1:9092,kafka-broker2:9092");
        properties.put("group.id", "my_group");
        properties.put("key.deserializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer");
        properties.put("value.deserializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer");
        
        KafkaConsumer<String, String> consumer = new KafkaConsumer<>(properties);
        consumer.subscribe(Collections.singletonList("my_topic"));
        
        ConsumerRecords<String, String> records = consumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(100));
        for (ConsumerRecord<String, String> record : records) {
        // Process the received event
        }
    
    RabbitMQ:
        RabbitMQ is a message broker that implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP).
        Producers publish messages to exchanges, and consumers subscribe to queues that are bound to these exchanges.

    AWS SQS/SNS:
        Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) and Simple Notification Service (SNS) are managed message queuing and publishing
        services provided by AWS.

Advantages of Event-Driven Design:

    Loose Coupling:
        Components are decoupled, allowing changes in one component without affecting others.

    Scalability:
        Systems can easily scale by adding more producers, consumers, or brokers.

    Asynchronous Communication:
        Events enable asynchronous communication, improving system responsiveness.

    Fault Tolerance:
        Redundancy and fault tolerance can be achieved by distributing components across multiple nodes.

    Flexibility:
        Components can be added, removed, or modified without disrupting the entire system.

Considerations:

    Event Schema:
        Define a clear schema for events to ensure consistency and compatibility between producers and consumers.

    Error Handling:
        Implement robust error-handling mechanisms to handle failures in event production, transmission, or consumption.

    Event Versioning:
        Plan for versioning of events to accommodate changes in the event structure over time.

    Monitoring and Logging:
        Implement monitoring and logging to track the flow of events, identify bottlenecks, and troubleshoot issues.

    Security:
        Ensure secure communication between components, especially when dealing with sensitive information.

Pub/Sub (Publish/Subscribe) is a form of event-driven architecture. In a Pub/Sub system, there are typically two main 
components: publishers and subscribers.

    Publishers: These are components responsible for producing and sending events (messages) to a central message broker or topic.

    Subscribers: These are components that express interest in certain types of events and receive notifications when relevant events occur.

The key characteristic of Pub/Sub is the decoupling of publishers and subscribers. Publishers do not need to have direct 
knowledge of the subscribers, and subscribers do not need to know about each publisher. This loose coupling allows for a more scalable and flexible architecture.

Here's a brief overview of how Pub/Sub works:

    Publishers: Produce and send events to a central message broker or a specific topic.

    Message Broker/Topic: Acts as an intermediary that receives events from publishers and delivers them to interested subscribers.

    Subscribers: Register interest in specific events or topics and receive notifications when those events occur.

    Asynchronous Communication: Events are sent and received asynchronously, allowing for better responsiveness and scalability.

Pub/Sub is commonly used in various scenarios, including:

    Inter-Service Communication: In microservices architectures, different services can communicate with each other without direct dependencies.

    Real-time Communication: In systems where real-time updates are required, such as chat applications or live streaming.

    Event-Driven Microservices: Pub/Sub is often employed in event-driven microservices architectures, allowing services to communicate without tight coupling.

Examples of Pub/Sub systems include Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport), and cloud-based 
solutions like AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service) and Google Cloud Pub/Sub.
